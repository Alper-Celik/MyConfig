## Win10 VM Script Parameters

# To modify GNOME settings to disable the screensaver, we 
# need to specify the username and ID. As well, when the 
# VM is turned off, we need to restore the amount of idle 
# time until the screen is turned off (in seconds)
LOGGED_IN_USERNAME=alper
LOGGED_IN_USERID=1000
GNOME_IDLE_DELAY=900

# How much memory we've assigned to the VM, in kibibytes 
VM_MEMORY=16777216

# Set the governor to use when the VM is on, and which 
# one we should return to once the VM is shut down
VM_ON_GOVERNOR=performance
VM_OFF_GOVERNOR=schedutil

# Set the powerprofiles ctl profile to performance when 
# the VM is on, and power-saver when the VM is shut down
VM_ON_PWRPROFILE=performance
VM_OFF_PWRPROFILE=power-saver

# Set which CPU's to isolate, and your system's total
# CPU's. For example, an 8-core, 16-thread processor has 
# 16 CPU's to the system, numbered 0-15. For a 6-core,
# 12-thread processor, 0-11. The SYS_TOTAL_CPUS variable 
# should always reflect this.
#
# You can define these as a range, a list, or both. I've 
# included some examples:
#
# EXAMPLE=0-3,8-11
# EXAMPLE=0,4,8,12
# EXAMPLE=0-3,8,11,12-15
VM_ISOLATED_CPUS=0-11
SYS_TOTAL_CPUS=0-31
